Socialho

A video of a person whose body or face has been digitally changed to make them appear to be someone else. These videos are becoming increasingly popular on social media and are usually used maliciously, to disseminate false information, exact revenge, or for defamatory purposes. The alteration of face features using deep generating techniques is known as a "deepfake", one of the most significant and severe cyberthreats. They execute the deep fakes flawlessly and blend in with the background, making it impossible for onlookers to identify them. Truthfulness is difficult to come by.

Socialho is a solution for this. Socialho is a social media platform in which just before posting there a check to examine if it the picture/video is manipulated. If it is, it will not permit to post. The model made for checking deepfakes also predicts the percentage of the content manipulated. The Google maps technology utilised in this will help us maintain track of who is uploading the deepfake photographs so that we have a complete record of that individual, including their location. 
Individual social development will benefit from this, and safety will be upheld.
